# PI-OfficeQA Pro V2 task repairs and exclusions

These corrections apply to upstream dataset revision
[`65a2b315780417bc50d7bfe6e5bdb904e63fda65`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/officeqa-pro-v2/tree/65a2b315780417bc50d7bfe6e5bdb904e63fda65).
IDs are CSV `uid` values, not positions in a filtered evaluation. The upstream
`source_docs` and `source_files` columns provide provenance that is not included
in the model-facing question.

## Dataset scope

In [tasks.json](tasks.json), **17 items receive repairs, task 88 is restored unchanged,
and 9 unresolved items are excluded**, including task 38 after follow-up source
verification. The dataset also excludes **3 visual-only tasks (46, 53, 54)**, leaving
**78 tasks**. Of the repaired tasks, 13 retain their original answer; tasks 36,
64, 71 and 85 have recomputed answers for their explicit source and account specifications.
All retained task IDs are preserved. The upstream corpus files are unchanged; the
offline image adds references and companion PDFs as described in [README.md](README.md).

The separate [OfficeQA-Pro-v2 environment](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-envs/tree/main/environments/search/officeqa_pro_v2)
loads all **90 original prompts and answers**, including tasks 36, 64, 71 and 85's original
keys. Report the benchmark variant with results: this corrected 78-task dataset is
not directly comparable to the original benchmark. Other source-extraction disagreements and visual-evidence dependencies
are not automatically classified as broken tasks. Task 55 remains included and needs
its bundled chart PDF. This is not certification of all 78 remaining source answers.

## Repaired and restored tasks

| UID | Repair | Verification and resulting answer |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | Explicit downside denominator: all nine annual changes, with zero shortfall for nonnegative changes. | Navy disbursement series gives 9.68. |
| 17 | Explicit CY1812 minus CY1815 population excess kurtosis. | Source metadata names both years; the extracted category vectors give 2.45. |
| 28 | One pooled mean absolute rank displacement across five offices and nine transitions; denominator 45. | Extracted rank panel has total movement 6, giving 0.1333. Squared movement is a different statistic. |
| 30 | Explicit negative sign for receipt contributions to deficit change; sum signed contributions before ranking. | Revised-series calculations reproduce [208.43%, -156.35%, 124.76%]. |
| 31 | Explicitly use each requested year's own Receipts by Source summary, without later revisions. | Direct inspection of the pinned FY2002/2004/2006/2008 tables reproduces [90.38, 89.78, 90.91, 91.40]. |
| 32 | Include the final unrecovered year in both duration and cumulative shortfall; specify own-year departmental summary. | FY1989 peak through FY1997 gives [8, 152260]. |
| 33 | Specify inverse HHI and bureau-level denominator, excluding subtotals and offsetting non-bureau rows. | Pinned FY1971/1975/1979 bureau tables give effective counts 8.2730, 7.5295, 7.3338; result [1971, 8.27]. |
| 35 | Rank ratios descending; select third-highest. | Extracted four-year ratios select [1979, 0.7865]. |
| 36 | Specify FY1981–1988, next-report prior-year columns in printed millions, and SES squared-error objective. | Recomputed key **25,196.60** for this explicit specification; see derivation below. |
| 51 | Restore documented FY1991–2000 transitions and FY1990 base; identify FRED RIFSPFFNA weights. | Metadata explicitly identifies CY1991–2000; extracted inputs reproduce 47.6821%. |
| 58 | Identify the current-year Salaries account under Public Printer. | The cited FY1913 account has $192,020.00 appropriated less $179,418.74 disbursed, leaving $12,601.26; preserve [1913, 12601.26]. |
| 64 | Preserve negative excess repayments when aggregating the named station accounts; keep the question unchanged. | Signed annual disbursements give **[16101, 16436, 15297, 16276, 15232, 12045, 10773, 10683, 14183, 14441]**. |
| 70 | Specify fund aggregation, positive/negative net transactions, receipts-to-redemptions direction and seven embedded triples. | First-order empirical conditional mutual information gives 0.4636 bits. |
| 71 | Include the FY1936–FY1938 Payment to Indians of Sioux reservations entries; use current-year appropriations in each year's own report. | Ten annual amounts total $3,634,075.00, giving the revised mean **$363,407.50**. |
| 77 | Specify surplus on lagged debt in nominal levels, 17 observations, intercept and no other regressors. | OLS on the extracted panel gives [-15163536.69, 0.38]. |
| 78 | Replace the ambiguous “debt acceleration” request with the second difference of annual fiscal deficits and its formula. | D1907 − 2D1906 + D1905 = -9893712.48. Deficits already proxy changes in debt, so these concepts must not be conflated. |
| 85 | Use the explicitly requested gross customs-collection outlays before repayments; keep the question unchanged. | Correlation of the four annual growth-rate pairs is **-0.6132**; the original -0.6525 uses net outlays. |
| 88 | Restore without changing the prompt or reference; the existing revision instruction already applies. | The FY1928 correction to FY1927 tolls reproduces the unchanged **-55,649,725**. |

The source-vintage choice in task 31 is deliberate: the upstream annotations cite
each year's own receipt report. Its question now explicitly overrides the general
latest-revision instruction. An alternative benchmark could instead ask for the
latest revisions and change the key, but it must make that choice consistently.

## Excluded pending adjudication

These rows are absent from `tasks.json` because no sufficiently supported repair
has been established. The table records the evidence needed to restore each row.

| UID | Blocking issue | Requirement for restoration |
|---|---|---|
| 29 | Receiver-panel OCR/subtotal choices cross the fourth-decimal rounding boundary (-0.3422 versus -0.3423). | Publish a checked six-state panel, including Illinois CY1835 treatment, and recalculate OLS. |
| 34 | Extracted annual top shares do not reconcile with reference 35.59. | Verify all ten annual numerators/denominators, revisions and precision; recompute the geometric mean. |
| 38 | Faithful reconstruction of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund outlays share change gives -34.95%, versus the -35.08% reference. | Verify the source panel and treatment of tax refunds, then reconcile or correct the reference. |
| 43 | Empirical mean-excess threshold grid, exceedance convention and pooled observations are unclear; reference remains unresolved. | Define thresholds, ties and maximum handling; verify the full observation panel and regression. |
| 52 | CVaR tail and the CPI base-year interpretation of nominal changes are unspecified. | Define tail and price-year conversion; freeze CPI values and reproduce the key. |
| 57 | A live “today” compensation comparator has no pinned annual index or snapshot for the requested 2026 value. | Archive the comparator inputs, output, actual index year and provenance; reconcile the reference. |
| 61 | Raw DFBETA versus standardized DFBETAS and the variance denominator are insufficiently specified. | State the exact influence formula and publish the checked monthly series supporting the key. |
| 65 | Receiver-year pooling and the squared-dollar SSD area need an explicit, reproducible definition. | Fix office/year weights and integral; verify receiver totals and recompute. |
| 80 | Annual values are requested against a scalar key without a transition/aggregation rule. | Specify the transition panel and either an annual answer list or a verified scalar aggregation. |

## Visual-only exclusions

Tasks **46, 53, and 54** are excluded from this dataset because their decisive
inputs are chart appearance, not reliably preserved in the parsed text. Their
reference answers are supported by the original PDFs; these are modality exclusions,
not unresolved answer keys. The PDFs remain in the shared offline corpus. The
separate original environment includes these tasks with their original prompts and answers.

| UID | Required visual input | PDF verification |
|---|---|---|
| 46 | Income-security legend shading in FY1995–2000 outlays-by-function charts. | Reference **5** counts FY1996–2000, including ties for the lightest white fill; FY1995 uses a darker gray. |
| 53 | Last monochrome perspective-rendered receipts-by-source pie chart across FY2001–2024. | Reference **2014**; FY2001–2014 are monochrome, while every FY2015–2024 chart uses color. |
| 54 | Individual income taxes shown in a non-green hue across FY2015–2024. | Reference **2018**; the category is orange in FY2018 and green in the other nine years. The question says non-green, not non-grey. |

The inspected sources are the six `combined_statement__transition__annrpt95.pdf`
through `annrpt00.pdf` reports and all 24
`combined_statement__modern__<year>__receipt.pdf` documents for FY2001–2024, at the
dataset revision above. Their pinned hashes are recorded in the corpus manifest.

## Task 36: source-backed revised key

The source annotations identify revised FY1981–FY1988 values from the FY1982–FY1989
reports. Directly reading Commerce, Interior, State, EPA and NASA from each report's
Statement of Operations prior-year column gives:

| FY | Combined printed outlays, millions |
|---|---:|
| 1981 | 19038 |
| 1982 | 19190 |
| 1983 | 19728 |
| 1984 | 20362 |
| 1985 | 21373 |
| 1986 | 22011 |
| 1987 | 22492 |
| 1988 | 24811 |

Source basenames are `combined_statement__historical__cs-1982.json` through
`cs-1989.json`. The parsed `bbox.page_id` values are 16, 21, then 28 for the final
six reports (the CSV's PDF page numbers are one higher).

OLS on time 1–8 gives slope 771.2023809524. The one-step squared-error objective
for the theta=2 series is minimized at alpha 1 in a grid over the closed interval
0–1 with increment 0.0001. At alpha 1, the equal-weight Theta forecast is the last
observation plus half the OLS slope: **25,196.6011904762**, rounding to **25,196.60**.

The upstream **25,196.36** is not asserted to be impossible under every alternate
source panel. The new answer applies to the now explicitly specified printed
source values. Original mode preserves the upstream question and answer.

## Task 51: interval evidence

The CSV explicitly names `RIFSPFFNA` weights for **CY1991–CY2000**. The following
receipt observations reproduce the unchanged **47.6821%** reference:

```text
FY1990–FY2000 individual income tax receipts (millions):
466884, 467827, 475964, 509680, 543055, 590243,
656417, 737466, 828587, 879480, 1004461

FY1990–FY2000 total receipts (millions):
1031307, 1054265, 1090453, 1153226, 1257453, 1351495,
1452765, 1578953, 1721465, 1827302, 2025037

CY1991–CY2000 annual weights:
5.69, 3.52, 3.02, 4.21, 5.83, 5.30, 5.46, 5.35, 4.97, 6.24
```

The calculation is 100 × sum(weight × change in individual taxes / change in
total receipts) / sum(weights). Treasury values were checked in the pinned
`cs-1991` through `cs-1994` and `annrpt96` through `annrpt00` sources. A fresh
FRED CSV download was unavailable during validation; the intended interval and
series are established by upstream metadata independently of the numeric match.
The FY1990 total also appears as 1,031,308 in another table, so this interval
repair is not certification of every last-digit source-vintage choice.

## Task 58: account selection

Task 58's phrase “department responsible for preparing and printing” admits
Treasury's bookkeeping or secretary offices as well as the printing office.
The upstream annotation explicitly names **Public Printer** in `cs-1913`, PDF
page 24 (parsed page 23). Its current-year Salaries row has appropriation
$192,020.00, disbursement $179,418.74, and unexpended balance **$12,601.26**.
The correction names that account; the seal-year question and reference stay
unchanged. This does not newly establish the first appearance of the seal.

## Task 64: preserve repayment signs

In the FY1904–FY1919 disbursement tables, excess repayments reduce disbursements.
The original key treats seven repayment magnitudes as positive spending:
FY1911 $1,463.94; FY1913 $1,927.82; FY1914 $837.04; FY1916 $1,664.73;
FY1917 $2,967.47; FY1918 $1,707.23; and FY1919 $3,778.70.
These signs are recoverable from agency subtotals and the appropriation accounts:
disbursement = opening balance + appropriation − surplus transfer − closing balance.
For example, the FY1913 special fund opens at $5,670.27 and closes at $7,598.09,
with no appropriation or surplus transfer: disbursement is **-$1,927.82**.

The signed totals of the accounts named in the question, in FY1904–FY1919 order, are:

```text
11478.38, 39503.13, 9420.56, 3039.70, 46762.05, 29487.59, 7241.60, 37137.30,
19943.67, 2418.76, 11036.42, 6719.78, 13645.01, 8307.66, 48140.88, 24224.97
```

Taking the population standard deviation of each consecutive seven-year window
and rounding only the result to whole dollars gives:

```text
[16101, 16436, 15297, 16276, 15232, 12045, 10773, 10683, 14183, 14441]
```

Sources are `combined_statement__historical__cs-1904.json` through `cs-1919.json`;
the original per-year page references remain in `source_docs`. Treating the seven
repayments as positive reproduces the original key, identifying the sign error.

## Task 71: account scope and source vintage

The upstream key **$294,407.50** equals the sum of FY1929–FY1935 appropriations
divided by ten, treating FY1936–FY1938 as zero. The old Sioux account label
continues to show prior-year activity, but the later reports also list
**Payment to Indians of Sioux reservations** under **Fulfilling treaties with**.
The repaired question explicitly includes these entries and uses the current
year's appropriations in each year's own report, overriding the general
latest-revision instruction.

| FY | Current-year appropriation |
|---|---:|
| 1929 | $382,000.00 |
| 1930 | $390,000.00 |
| 1931 | $440,000.00 |
| 1932 | $445,000.00 |
| 1933 | $445,000.00 |
| 1934 | $428,000.00 |
| 1935 | $414,075.00 |
| 1936 | $190,000.00 |
| 1937 | $190,000.00 |
| 1938 | $310,000.00 |

The first seven entries follow the upstream `cs-1929` through `cs-1935`
annotations. The final three are in `combined_statement__historical__cs-1936.json`
through `cs-1938.json`, parsed pages **240, 255 and 273**, respectively
(zero-based `bbox.page_id`; elements 1501, 1484 and 1658 in the captured extraction).
The ten amounts sum to **$3,634,075.00**, so the revised mean is **$363,407.50**.
The FY1938 table also contains a $52,000 appropriation tagged FY1937 and other
prior-year adjustments. Those are excluded by the own-year/current-year rule;
mixing them into earlier observations gives a different mean.

This repair makes the included account labels explicit. It does not claim that
all similarly named Sioux accounts are interchangeable, or establish their legal
continuity from statutes. The old key is reproducible under the narrower original
label, but the original question never specified that restriction. Original mode
preserves it verbatim.

The evidence above comes from tool-returned corpus tables in hosted evaluation
[`toat78o31cvmjjrd2e2u0str`](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/evaluations/toat78o31cvmjjrd2e2u0str):
trace `6dd7a132bb37440884288be085348dea`, tool node 28 (58); and
`936e6ec5f4654aa6b61bd949e2026f7e`, tool nodes 34 and 36 (71).
These are recorded source excerpts, not a new PDF/OCR audit or a regrade of that run.

## Task 85: gross outlays before repayments

The question explicitly requests gross customs-collection outlays before repayments.
The Treasurer's reports list the gross amount before “From which deduct the following
repayments”; the original key instead uses the amount remaining after that deduction.

| FY | Receipts credited against collection costs | Gross outlays before repayments | Net outlays after repayments |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1875 | 1,340,913.07 | 7,081,054.20 | 7,029,215.27 |
| 1876 | 1,210,101.45 | 6,805,834.16 | 6,702,351.04 |
| 1877 | 1,044,696.68 | 6,591,682.05 | 6,501,037.57 |
| 1878 | 1,046,864.36 | 5,887,443.69 | 5,826,974.32 |
| 1879 | 1,100,871.66 | 5,564,104.67 | 5,485,543.87 |

For each series, calculate four simple annual growth rates as `current / previous - 1`.
Their Pearson correlation is **-0.613211579360...**, rounding to **-0.6132**.
Substituting net outlays reproduces the original **-0.652493591392... → -0.6525**.

The credited receipts come from `combined_statement__historical__cs-1875.json`
through `cs-1879.json`; gross and net outlays come from the corresponding
`govinfo_receipts__1875__...json` through `govinfo_receipts__1879__...json`
Treasurer's reports. Full filenames and page references remain in `source_docs`.
The question and source annotations are unchanged.

## Task 88: restore the original task with corrected tolls

The existing question already specifies non-toll receipts, warrant-basis operating
spending, the opening FY1920 balance, and year-end discounting at 3%. The general
prompt requires later revisions. No prompt or reference change is needed.

In `combined_statement__historical__cs-1928.json`, parsed page **51**, element
**298**, the Treasury explicitly corrects its FY1927 report: toll receipts were
understated by **$482,776.91**, and net profits overstated by the same amount.
Tolls should be **$24,239,771.10**, replacing **$23,756,994.19**. This correction
was checked directly in the pinned parsed corpus. Holding total receipts fixed
therefore reduces non-toll receipts by $482,776.91.

The opening balance is **$5,133,849.96**. The corrected net non-toll flows for
FY1920–FY1929 are:

```text
-5,485,252.76; -15,626,628.09; -1,941,136.67; -2,980,326.26;
-5,580,420.06; -7,896,406.68; -7,397,908.76; -6,308,445.68;
-9,478,024.22; -8,894,066.08
```

Opening balance + sum(flow_t / 1.03^t), for t=1 through 10, is
**-55,649,724.7136548...**, rounding to the original **-55,649,725**.
Using the uncorrected toll value instead gives **-55,268,616.162787...**,
which accounts for the previously unresolved difference. The FY1927 correction
is discounted eight years, not seven.

The annual source tables and calculation are recorded in tool outputs of trace
`793eb45720d348279d2682ecc4c4657c` in the linked evaluation (especially nodes
34 and 36). Source files are `cs-1920` through `cs-1929`. Three of the four saved
attempts already use the correction and match the reference. The original task
is restored because the source evidence resolves the exclusion, not merely
because some attempts passed.

## Evidence and limits

The numeric inputs were extracted from solver traces, with additional direct
pinned-corpus checks for the source-sensitive repairs (especially 31, 33, 36, 51
and 88). This does not establish that every historical OCR transcription is
correct. The task 30 analysis covers the three reported contributions, not a new
exhaustive source extraction of all 28 categories.

Source families for the other audited tasks follow the CSV annotations: Navy
recapitulations `cs-1900`–`cs-1909` (3), CY1812/CY1815 expenditure categories (17),
FY1850–FY1859 Navy bureau-office civil-list records (28), FY2020–FY2024 receipt and
outlay summaries (30), FY1985–FY1997 departmental outlay summaries (32),
FY1973/1975/1976/1979 agency outlays (35), `cs-1961`–`cs-1969` special-issue debt
transactions (70), the 1866 historical receipt/expenditure series and `cs-1952`
debt Table 10 (77), and `cs-1905`–`cs-1907` receipts/disbursements (78).
