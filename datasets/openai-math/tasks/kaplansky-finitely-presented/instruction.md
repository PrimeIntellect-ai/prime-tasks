# openai/math challenge `KaplanskyFinitelyPresented` (family 197)

Prove the following result from OpenAI's [openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math) release in
Lean 4, with a proof the Lean kernel accepts.

Context: this statement belongs to family 197 of the release, *Nonsofic groups and group-ring counterexamples*
(Algebra). The family as a whole: Constructs a finitely presented torsion-free nonsofic group whose group algebra over $\mathbb F_2$ is not directly finite, disproving Kaplansky's conjecture even without torsion. Companion examples give injective nonsurjective cellular automata on all configurations, refuting Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture. Another counterexample is an integral group-ring matrix, invertible over the rational group ring, with Fuglede–Kadison determinant strictly between zero and one, disproving the unrestricted Determinant Conjecture.

The challenge is `KaplanskyFinitelyPresented`, also at `/opt/openai-math/challenges/KaplanskyFinitelyPresented.lean`:

```lean
import Mathlib

namespace OAI.KaplanskyCounterexample

/-- A finite characteristic-two field and a finitely presented group with odd-prime
order torsion give a counterexample to direct finiteness (paper, Theorem 1.1). -/
theorem finitelyPresented_counterexample :
    ∃ (K : Type) (_ : Field K) (_ : Fintype K) (_ : CharP K 2),
      ∃ (G : Type) (_ : Group G) (_ : Group.IsFinitelyPresented G),
        (∃ (ℓ : ℕ) (_ : ℓ.Prime) (_ : Odd ℓ) (g : G), orderOf g = ℓ) ∧
        ∃ a_out b_out : MonoidAlgebra K G, a_out * b_out = 1 ∧ b_out * a_out ≠ 1 := by
  sorry

end OAI.KaplanskyCounterexample
```

## What to submit

Write `/workspace/Submission.lean`. Start from a copy of the challenge:

```bash
cp /opt/openai-math/challenges/KaplanskyFinitelyPresented.lean /workspace/Submission.lean
```

then replace every `sorry` with a proof. The file is graded on three things:

- **Same statements.** The theorem `OAI.KaplanskyCounterexample.finitelyPresented_counterexample` must keep exactly the statement shown above: same names,
  namespaces, binders and types. Every definition the statements use must stay exactly as written.
  Change nothing except the proofs.
- **Standard axioms only.** Proofs may use only `propext`, `Quot.sound` and `Classical.choice`.
  `sorry`, `admit`, new `axiom`s and `native_decide` (it introduces an axiom of its own) are rejected.
- **Keep the challenge's declarations as they are.** Put new lemmas and instances *after* the
  definitions the statements use, or in a separate `Submission/*.lean` module. A declaration added
  before them can change how they elaborate, and then they no longer match the challenge.
- **Kernel-checked.** The proofs are re-checked by the Lean kernel, not just the elaborator.

Long proofs can be split into modules under `/workspace/Submission/` (module names
`Submission.Foo`, `Submission.Foo.Bar`) imported from `Submission.lean`. Only `.lean` files at
those two paths are graded.

## Environment

- Lean `v4.34.1` and Mathlib at commit `d13f23b` are installed and prebuilt; `/workspace` is a
  Lake project.
- The sandbox has 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory; `LEAN_NUM_THREADS=3` keeps `lake build` to three
  parallel jobs. Check your work with `cd /workspace && lake build Submission`. Add `#print axioms <name>` to see
  which axioms a proof uses.
- There is no internet access. OpenAI's own proofs are not installed.

## Grading

When you finish, `Submission.lean` and `Submission/**.lean` are copied to a fresh machine and
checked with [Comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator), the Lean FRO's proof checker.
The reward is 1 if Comparator accepts the proof and 0 otherwise. A partial proof scores 0.
