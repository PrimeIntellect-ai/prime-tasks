# openai/math challenge `MatroidProphet` (family 111)

Prove the following result from OpenAI's [openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math) release in
Lean 4, with a proof the Lean kernel accepts.

Context: this statement belongs to family 111 of the release, *One-sample matroid prophet inequalities against an almighty adversary*
(Theoretical computer science). The family as a whole: For every finite matroid known in advance, gives a distribution-independent online rule using one independent sample per element and earning a universal constant fraction of the expected offline optimum. Values are independent and nonnegative, with finite expected optimum. The guarantee holds even when the arrival-order adversary sees all samples, values, and the rule's entire random seed; no polynomial-time implementation is asserted.

The challenge is `MatroidProphet`, also at `/opt/openai-math/challenges/MatroidProphet.lean`:

```lean
import Mathlib

namespace OAI

/-!
# One-sample matroid selection

The rule and its finite seed law depend only on the known labeled matroid.
A decision sees the initial sample vector, the entire seed, and the arriving
label/value prefix. Every prefix is feasible, and decisions are irrevocable.
The arrival permutation may depend on all samples, values, and seed bits.
Only the actual offline optimum is required to be integrable.

## What to submit

Write `/workspace/Submission.lean`. Start from a copy of the challenge:

```bash
cp /opt/openai-math/challenges/MatroidProphet.lean /workspace/Submission.lean
```

then replace every `sorry` with a proof. The file is graded on three things:

- **Same statements.** The theorem `OAI.MatroidProphet.one_sample` must keep exactly the statement shown above: same names,
  namespaces, binders and types. Every definition the statements use must stay exactly as written.
  Change nothing except the proofs.
- **Standard axioms only.** Proofs may use only `propext`, `Quot.sound` and `Classical.choice`.
  `sorry`, `admit`, new `axiom`s and `native_decide` (it introduces an axiom of its own) are rejected.
- **Keep the challenge's declarations as they are.** Put new lemmas and instances *after* the
  definitions the statements use, or in a separate `Submission/*.lean` module. A declaration added
  before them can change how they elaborate, and then they no longer match the challenge.
- **Kernel-checked.** The proofs are re-checked by the Lean kernel, not just the elaborator.

Long proofs can be split into modules under `/workspace/Submission/` (module names
`Submission.Foo`, `Submission.Foo.Bar`) imported from `Submission.lean`. Only `.lean` files at
those two paths are graded.

## Environment

- Lean `v4.34.1` and Mathlib at commit `d13f23b` are installed and prebuilt; `/workspace` is a
  Lake project.
- The sandbox has 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory; `LEAN_NUM_THREADS=3` keeps `lake build` to three
  parallel jobs. Check your work with `cd /workspace && lake build Submission`. Add `#print axioms <name>` to see
  which axioms a proof uses.
- There is no internet access. OpenAI's own proofs are not installed.

## Grading

When you finish, `Submission.lean` and `Submission/**.lean` are copied to a fresh machine and
checked with [Comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator), the Lean FRO's proof checker.
The reward is 1 if Comparator accepts the proof and 0 otherwise. A partial proof scores 0.
