# openai/math challenge `EuclideanRamseyCircle` (family 172)

Prove the following result from OpenAI's [openai/math](https://github.com/openai/math) release in
Lean 4, with a proof the Lean kernel accepts.

Context: this statement belongs to family 172 of the release, *Classification of finite Euclidean Ramsey configurations*
(Combinatorics). The family as a whole: Classifies finite point configurations that occur monochromatically, at their original scale, in every finite coloring of sufficiently high-dimensional Euclidean space. The characterization is an algebraic condition over the coordinate field. It also disproves the Leader–Russell–Walters conjecture that every such configuration is a subset of a finite transitive set.

The challenge is `EuclideanRamseyCircle`, also at `/opt/openai-math/challenges/EuclideanRamseyCircle.lean`:

```lean
import Mathlib

namespace OAI

noncomputable section
namespace EuclideanRamsey

abbrev Space (d : ℕ) := EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)

def Congruent {s d D : ℕ} (a : Fin s → Space d) (b : Fin s → Space D) : Prop :=
  ∀ i j, dist (b i) (b j) = dist (a i) (a j)

def Ramsey {s d : ℕ} (a : Fin s → Space d) : Prop :=
  ∀ r : ℕ, 2 ≤ r → ∃ D : ℕ, 1 ≤ D ∧
    ∀ c : Space D → Fin r, ∃ b : Fin s → Space D,
      Congruent a b ∧ ∃ k : Fin r, ∀ i, c (b i) = k

namespace CircleConsequence

end CircleConsequence
end EuclideanRamsey

end

end OAI
```

## What to submit

Write `/workspace/Submission.lean`. Start from a copy of the challenge:

```bash
cp /opt/openai-math/challenges/EuclideanRamseyCircle.lean /workspace/Submission.lean
```

then replace every `sorry` with a proof. The file is graded on three things:

- **Same statements.** The theorem `OAI.EuclideanRamsey.CircleConsequence.at_most_five_circle_points_ramsey` must keep exactly the statement shown above: same names,
  namespaces, binders and types. Every definition the statements use must stay exactly as written.
  Change nothing except the proofs.
- **Standard axioms only.** Proofs may use only `propext`, `Quot.sound` and `Classical.choice`.
  `sorry`, `admit`, new `axiom`s and `native_decide` (it introduces an axiom of its own) are rejected.
- **Keep the challenge's declarations as they are.** Put new lemmas and instances *after* the
  definitions the statements use, or in a separate `Submission/*.lean` module. A declaration added
  before them can change how they elaborate, and then they no longer match the challenge.
- **Kernel-checked.** The proofs are re-checked by the Lean kernel, not just the elaborator.

Long proofs can be split into modules under `/workspace/Submission/` (module names
`Submission.Foo`, `Submission.Foo.Bar`) imported from `Submission.lean`. Only `.lean` files at
those two paths are graded.

## Environment

- Lean `v4.34.1` and Mathlib at commit `d13f23b` are installed and prebuilt; `/workspace` is a
  Lake project.
- The sandbox has 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory; `LEAN_NUM_THREADS=3` keeps `lake build` to three
  parallel jobs. Check your work with `cd /workspace && lake build Submission`. Add `#print axioms <name>` to see
  which axioms a proof uses.
- There is no internet access. OpenAI's own proofs are not installed.

## Grading

When you finish, `Submission.lean` and `Submission/**.lean` are copied to a fresh machine and
checked with [Comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator), the Lean FRO's proof checker.
The reward is 1 if Comparator accepts the proof and 0 otherwise. A partial proof scores 0.
