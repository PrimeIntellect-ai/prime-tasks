# Torch Tensor Parallelism

## Overview

This task requires implementing tensor parallelism for PyTorch linear layers. Agents must create `ColumnParallelLinear` and `RowParallelLinear` classes in `/app/parallel_linear.py` that distribute weight matrices across multiple processes using PyTorch's distributed primitives.

## What This Task Tests

- **Distributed Training Concepts**: Understanding of tensor parallelism and model parallelism patterns
- **PyTorch Distributed APIs**: Using `torch.distributed` for multi-process coordination
- **Autograd**: Preserving the required weight and bias gradients through distributed operations
- **Weight Sharding**: Correctly partitioning weight matrices across ranks
- **Distributed Communication**: Implementing all_gather and all_reduce operations for forward/backward passes

## Key Details

### Classes to Implement

1. **ColumnParallelLinear**: Splits weight matrix by columns (output dimension)
   - Full output equivalent to concatenating the rank outputs
   - Bias sharded along output dimension

2. **RowParallelLinear**: Splits weight matrix by rows (input dimension)
   - Full output equivalent to summing the rank outputs
   - Bias remains full on each rank
   - `forward` receives this rank's pre-sliced input shard (last dim = `in_features // world_size`)

### Environment

- **Base Image**: Ubuntu 24.04 (fixed image: `pi-terminalbench2-1/torch-tensor-parallelism:2.1`)
- **Python**: 3.13 (baked into the image at `/opt/venv`, on PATH)
- **Key Dependencies**: PyTorch 2.7.0 (CPU build), pytest 8.4.1, pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5 (all baked into the image)
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 4GB RAM
- **Network**: no external runtime downloads; Gloo workers communicate locally.
  The uv 0.9.5 CPU index has priority over the PyPI fallback. Python patch versions
  and transitive dependencies resolve during image construction; no current build
  or runtime result is established by these source files.

### Verification

The test suite (`test_outputs.py`) validates:
- File existence (`parallel_linear.py`)
- Exact shard/output/gradient shapes and values match the reference with
  `torch.allclose(atol=1e-5)` and its default relative tolerance
- Bias starts at zero; the original zero-bias sum-loss case is retained, followed
  by nonzero bias and a nonuniform output gradient
- Test tensors are generated before the candidate constructor so rank-dependent
  random-number use cannot change the reference inputs
- Functionality across world_size values: 1, 2, and 4
- Both with and without bias terms

The workload is fixed at batch size 2, input width 64, output width 48, seed 42,
and CPU float32. Input gradients, other shapes/dtypes, parameter registration,
memory savings, and communication mechanisms are not checked. Custom autograd,
ordinary differentiable operations, or other collective implementations are valid
if they satisfy the stated behavior. No hook or helper-library ban applies.

Each test creates a new FileStore rendezvous path shared by local workers; the
filesystem must support locking. Gloo operations have a 60-second timeout, and
workers have a 120-second deadline per case. The parent kills and joins remaining
workers on failure or timeout. Pytest stops after the first failing case so a hang
does not consume the entire 900-second verifier budget across repeated cases.
Rank startup/completion messages, delayed worker stack traces, and verbose pytest
output are saved to `/logs/verifier/pytest.log`; the original pytest exit code is
saved to `/logs/verifier/pytest-exit-code.txt`. Per-case deadline failures are reported as
`TimeoutError`, while worker assertion tracebacks propagate through PyTorch. Both
remain failed grades under the binary reward contract; the logs are needed to
distinguish candidate failures from infrastructure issues. An outer kill can still
prevent writing the final reward or CTRF file.

The submitted module is imported in the shared task environment. The artifact
declaration names the file for collection; it is not a separate verifier transfer
or security boundary. The wrapper maps all nonzero pytest exits, including setup
errors, to reward zero.
