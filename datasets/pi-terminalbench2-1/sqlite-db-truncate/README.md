# SQLite fragment recovery

Recover rows from the supplied /app/trunc.db fragment and save a JSON array to /app/recover.json. No particular language, script, SQLite library, or recovery method is required. The fragment lacks a database file header; it is not a complete database that can be opened directly.

The grader accepts at least seven distinct correct word/value pairs out of ten and rejects every false pair. Each object needs a string word and a JSON number value; booleans and numeric strings are rejected. Equal integers and floats are accepted. Row order, duplicate correct rows, and extra object fields do not affect matching.

The input bytes are unchanged. The reference reads cell pointers and SQLite record serial types directly; it is an example for this fragment, not a general damaged-database recovery library.

The image bakes Python 3.13, pytest 8.4.1 and pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5. Building requires external package access; agent and verifier configuration disables external networking. Mutable image tags and transitive packages are not a fully locked build. The shared verifier reads the output in place; the artifact declaration is not a separate security or transfer boundary.

The wrapper writes one for a passing pytest exit and zero otherwise. A binary reward does not distinguish submission failure from infrastructure failure; inspect the logs. The declared limits are one CPU, 2 GiB memory, 10 GiB storage, 900 seconds for each agent and verifier phase, and 600 seconds for image construction.

Static source review does not establish that the revised image builds, the reference runs, or a historical solution passes the revised grader.
