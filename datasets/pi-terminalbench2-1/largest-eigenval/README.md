# Largest Eigenvalue Optimization

## Overview

This task requires the agent to optimize the `find_dominant_eigenvalue_and_eigenvector` function in `/app/eigen.py`. The function must find the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude and its corresponding eigenvector for finite real-valued square matrices (1x1 through 10x10), but run faster than the baseline NumPy implementation (`np.linalg.eig`).

## Skills Tested

- **Code optimization**: Improving performance while maintaining correctness
- **Numerical computing**: Understanding eigenvalue algorithms and their performance characteristics
- **Mathematical correctness**: Ensuring the solution satisfies the eigenvalue equation `A @ eigenvec = eigenval * eigenvec`
- **Benchmarking**: Understanding performance measurement with median times across multiple runs

## Environment

- **Base image**: `python:3.13-slim-bookworm` (built locally as `pi-terminalbench2-1/largest-eigenval:2.1`)
- **Pre-installed packages**: NumPy 2.3.0 (agent-facing), plus pytest 8.4.1 and pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5 (baked in for the verifier)
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 2GB RAM — runs and timing comparisons must be recorded under this declared envelope
- **Internet access**: Disabled (`network_mode = "no-network"` for agent and verifier phases)
- **Working directory**: `/app`
- **Grading model**: the verifier runs `bash /tests/test.sh` inside this SAME container the agent worked in (shared mode); no `[artifacts]` are declared on purpose, because the hidden tests import the agent's `/app/eigen.py` and its site-packages directly. Collecting into a fresh verifier container would break agent-installed dependencies.

## Verification

The test suite (`test_outputs.py`) verifies:

1. **Correctness**: A finite nonzero eigenvector is normalized to unit norm before NumPy’s default `allclose` eigen-equation check. Three random seeds are checked at each size 2 through 10, alongside five structured cases. Candidate calls receive copies, so in-place algorithms can be checked against the original input. Size 1 is in the input domain but is not sampled.
2. **Dominance**: The returned eigenvalue must have the largest magnitude among all eigenvalues
3. **Performance**: For every size 2x2 through 10x10, 100 random matrices are generated, the reference NumPy solution is timed first and then the candidate in a worker, and the candidate's median time per call must be strictly lower than the reference median for that size; the timing is repeated 3 times (median of per-repeat medians), and the function is called again in the parent process on five of the matrices to check correctness

Timing uses a forkserver worker; correctness checks run in the parent. The timed return values are discarded, so the later parent calls do not validate those exact outputs or exclude process-dependent behavior. Each worker submission receives serialized inputs; changes to an array in one submission do not change a later submission’s input. A shared worker and the parent still execute candidate code with mutable Python state. Capturing function references reduces simple attribute replacement but is not a security boundary, and a worker does not eliminate CPU contention.

Locally available dependencies and other implementation languages are allowed through the Python entrypoint. No online installation is needed by the verifier or reference solution. The reference calls NumPy’s private LAPACK wrapper, with a small import-time probe and public-API fallback; private-API availability and strict speedup remain runtime questions. Its diagnostic uses a different random seed schedule and timing setup, does not normalize the residual, and treats slower timings as informational. The public `eval.py` is also a partial diagnostic rather than the hidden verifier.

The three timing repeats reduce some noise but do not establish a calibrated false-rejection rate. The 30-second future waits do not forcibly terminate running work; the task’s outer verifier limit remains relevant. The image and reference have not been executed as part of this static review. Shared runtime authority and infrastructure-to-zero reward behavior are tracked in the suite review.
