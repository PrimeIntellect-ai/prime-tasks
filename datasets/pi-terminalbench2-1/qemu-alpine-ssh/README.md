# QEMU Alpine Linux SSH Setup

## Change Log

- [#1957](https://github.com/harbor-framework/terminal-bench/pull/1957) Pinned Bullseye security repository in agent environment.

Boot the supplied Alpine ISO in QEMU and configure a guest SSH server so root can log in with `password123` through port 2223. This avoids port 2222, reserved by the Prime sandbox service. A live ISO session or an installation to the supplied disk is acceptable. Console automation, launcher, SSH daemon configuration and hostname are implementation choices; the guest and its SSH server must remain available for verification.

The Debian Bullseye image includes QEMU, qemu-utils, OpenSSH client, sshpass, telnet, netcat, expect, tmux and asciinema. The verifier uses uv-managed Python 3.13, pytest 8.4.1 and pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5 under `/opt/venv`. Guest OpenSSH packages are available from the extended ISO's local repository. Runtime networking is disabled; building the image still downloads Debian packages, the ISO and Python tooling. The ISO URL and SHA-256 are fixed. The Debian sshpass package uses the distribution version rather than an unavailable old revision.

Declared resources are 1 CPU, 4 GiB memory, 10 GiB storage and 900-second agent/verifier limits. The optional 32 GiB qcow2 disk has virtual capacity larger than the storage budget; a sparse image does not reserve that full capacity, but actual guest writes consume storage. No image build or VM execution was performed during this static review.

The grader disables ordinary SSH configuration files and both known-hosts databases, permits password and keyboard-interactive authentication, disables public-key authentication, and requests `uname -r` from the fixed endpoint. It requires a successful command and the supplied ISO's kernel string `6.6.4-1-lts`. The ten-second connection timeout covers initial connection/handshake; a separate 900-second subprocess deadline matches the declared verifier budget, so the outer deadline can still fire first. This is a limited command probe. It does not establish interactive-shell behavior, prove that an authentication server validates the supplied password, authenticate a specific VM, or establish which trial owns the listener.

Per-trial network isolation and preservation of guest processes through grading are harness responsibilities. A shared hostname or loopback bind cannot isolate concurrent trials in one network namespace. Daemonizing the reference VM avoids tying it to its immediate shell but does not guarantee survival of harness/container teardown. The reference now propagates shell failures and console timeout/EOF, and waits for a complete output line after guest setup; its timing and handoff remain untested. The reward wrapper still maps infrastructure failures to zero rather than a structured harness error.
