# Portfolio Optimization Task

## Overview
This task requires implementing a high-performance C extension for portfolio calculations. Agents must complete skeleton files (`portfolio_optimized.c` and `portfolio_optimized.py`) to create a faster implementation than the provided Python baseline, which uses inefficient nested loops.

## What the Task Tests
- **C programming skills**: Writing C extensions for Python using the Python C API and NumPy C API
- **Performance optimization**: Creating code that is at least 1.2x faster than the baseline for portfolios with 5000+ assets
- **Numerical accuracy**: Ensuring results match the Python baseline within 1e-10 tolerance
- **Scalability**: Handling portfolios with up to 8000 assets

## Mathematical Background
The implementation must calculate:
- **Portfolio risk**: `sqrt(x^T * S * x)` where x = weights, S = covariance matrix
- **Portfolio return**: `x^T * r` where r = expected returns

## Environment Details
- **Base image**: `python:3.13-slim-bookworm`
- **Pre-installed tools**:
  - Build tools (gcc, g++, build-essential)
  - Python packages: numpy==2.3.2, setuptools==78.1.1, pytest==8.4.1, pytest-json-ctrf==0.3.5
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 4GB RAM, 10GB storage
- **Build command**: `python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace`
- **Test command**: `python3 benchmark.py`

## Verification
The test suite (`test.sh`) runs the baked Python interpreter against the live `/app` submission:
1. **C extension exists**: Checks the imported module's filename suffix and both entry-point names
2. **Baseline functionality**: Confirms the Python baseline works correctly
3. **Direct extension math**: Calls both extension functions on contiguous float64 arrays for 233 assets
4. **Correctness (small)**: Tests the wrapper on 100-asset lists and 150-asset NumPy views with gaps in their storage
5. **Performance & scalability**: Tests on 5000, 6000, and 8000 asset portfolios:
   - Risk and return must have absolute error strictly less than 1e-10
   - Risk uses the minimum of three baseline calls divided by the minimum of three wrapper calls, with speedup at least 1.2x
   - Every timed result is checked outside its measured interval; wrapper conversion time is included

Plain C loops, C-side input conversion, stride-aware C, and C code using available numerical libraries are valid approaches. A wrapper may copy arrays or preserve their strides; no particular conversion function is required. The task asks for a C implementation, so replacing the calculations with a Python-only wrapper does not meet that objective.

Tests use a separate baseline copy and reproducible seeds distinct from the public benchmark. Those seeds remain predictable. The finite direct-extension probe rejects the shipped zero-return stubs but does not prove that every wrapper call delegates to C, nor that all possible inputs work. The filename check is not proof of native-code provenance. Inputs are reused for timing; caching is not prohibited, and these checks do not establish cache validity after every possible input mutation. Only risk performance is measured. The generator creates symmetric matrices with positive entries, without proving positive definiteness for arbitrary weights.

The public benchmark covers all three large sizes and exits nonzero on reported correctness or performance failure. It is a local diagnostic, not the hidden grader. The reference stops on build or benchmark failure. Neither the image build nor numerical accuracy, timing, or memory use has been dynamically validated by this source review.

Dependencies are fetched during image construction; solving and verification have no install steps. The task declares 1 CPU, 4096 MiB memory and 10240 MiB storage. Historical runs under different resources do not validate these limits. Verifier logs and `/app` are declared as artifacts, but grading uses shared live state. Protection of the interpreter, imports, baseline and reward requires a harness authority boundary; missing-tool diagnostics alone do not give infrastructure failures a separate reward status.
