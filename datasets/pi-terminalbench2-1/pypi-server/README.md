# PyPI Server Setup Task

## Overview

This task requires the agent to create a Python package called `vectorops` (version 0.1.0), build it, and set up a local PyPI server on port 8080 that hosts the package. The package must be installable using pip with the `--index-url` parameter pointing to the local server.

## Task Requirements

The agent must:
1. Create a Python package named `vectorops` with version `0.1.0`
2. Implement a `dotproduct` function that calculates the dot product of two lists of numbers
3. The function must be importable as `from vectorops import dotproduct`
4. Build an installable distribution; the packaging backend and server implementation are open choices
5. Set up a PyPI server running on `http://localhost:8080`
6. Host the built package on the server
7. Ensure the package is installable via: `pip install --index-url http://localhost:8080/simple vectorops==0.1.0`
8. Keep the server running: grading happens after the agent session ends, and the verifier installs the package live from `http://localhost:8080/simple`

## Skills Tested

- **Python Package Development**: Creating proper package structure with `__init__.py` and metadata
- **Build Tools**: Building an installable distribution (for example, with setuptools)
- **PyPI Server Configuration**: Setting up and running a local package index (e.g. `pypiserver`)
- **Package Distribution**: Building and hosting packages on a package index
- **System Administration**: Managing services and configuring server endpoints

## Environment Details

- **Base Image**: `python:3.13-slim-bookworm` (fixed offline image: `pi-terminalbench2-1/pypi-server:2.1`)
- **Pre-installed Tools**: Python 3.13, pip 25.2, setuptools 75.6.0, wheel 0.45.1, curl, vim, apache2-utils (htpasswd), procps (ps/pgrep)
- **Baked wheelhouse**: `/opt/wheels` (pypiserver 2.3.2, passlib 1.7.4, bcrypt 4.3.0, packaging 25.0, build 1.3.0, twine 6.1.0, setuptools 75.6.0, wheel 0.45.1) — install with `pip install --no-index --find-links=/opt/wheels <pkg>`
- **Baked verifier venv**: `/opt/verifier-venv` (pytest 8.4.1, pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5, pip 25.2)
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB storage
- **Internet Access**: None (offline task; install dependencies from the baked wheelhouse instead of PyPI)
- **Timeouts**: 15 minutes for agent, 15 minutes for verifier

## Verification

The verifier uses the baked Python interpreter and pip 25.2 to uninstall and reinstall `vectorops==0.1.0` with the explicit localhost index. Python isolated mode, disabled pip configuration, ignored installed copies and disabled caches reduce accidental fallback to local source or another configured index. A fresh interpreter imports the public function and returns results for seven equal-length integer/float cases, including nonzero signed and fractional products. The parent compares the reported package version and numerical results. Function logging is permitted. These finite, public cases do not prove the general algorithm or authorship.

Any compatible package index is allowed: a static Simple API directory served by `http.server`, pypiserver, or another implementation. Authentication and twine are optional. Wheels and source distributions are allowed; an sdist must make its build dependencies available offline, and the wheelhouse is not a promise that every possible build backend is covered. No policy for unequal-length lists is tested.

The server must survive into grading in the same container/network namespace. The current test installs once and does not continuously monitor it through the end of grading. The reference detaches stdin and waits for an HTTP response before upload; that checks readiness, not process ownership or survival under arbitrary harness teardown. The base image and transitive dependencies are not fully locked, and no image build or runtime replay was performed for this review.

The installation environment, Python/pip binaries, shared filesystem and verifier remain mutable by the solver. These checks reduce ordinary configuration/import mistakes; they do not establish a security boundary or prove that all bytes came from a particular server process. Bootstrap, collection and test failures still map to zero in the supporting harness unless it records them separately. Declared logs improve diagnosis only when actually collected.
