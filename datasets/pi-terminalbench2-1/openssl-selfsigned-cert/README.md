# OpenSSL self-signed certificate

Create an RSA-2048 key, a self-signed certificate for the named internal server, a combined PEM, certificate details, and a Python loading/checking script. The key must have mode 0600. The reference also protects the combined PEM with mode 0600 as good practice. The task does not prescribe a Python library, PEM block order, or PKCS#1 versus PKCS#8 key encoding. Available local packages may be used without network access.

## Environment

The image uses python:3.13-slim-bookworm, installs OpenSSL with apt, and bakes pytest==8.4.1 and pytest-json-ctrf==0.3.5. Building requires access to the base image, apt and PyPI; agent and verifier phases declare no network. Base image, apt version and transitive Python dependencies are not fully pinned. The declared envelope is one CPU, 2048 MiB RAM, 10240 MiB disk and 900-second agent/verifier limits.

## Grading

Six tests inspect the shared filesystem:

- /app/ssl is a directory. server.key resolves to a regular file with exactly mode 0600, including rejection of special permission bits, and OpenSSL loads it as RSA-2048.
- server.crt loads, has the required CN and organization, equal issuer and subject names, and the same exported public key as server.key. Its validity interval is exactly 365 days.
- server.pem loads a certificate with the same SHA-256 fingerprint as server.crt and a private key with the same exported public key as server.key.
- verification.txt contains the required subject strings, both actual validity dates, and the actual SHA-256 fingerprint in colon-separated or contiguous hex. Date extraction accepts ISO dates and OpenSSL dates with or without GMT/UTC, without consuming labels on following lines.
- /app/check_cert.py exits successfully and prints the required success phrase, CN and actual ISO expiry date.

Equal names establish self-issuance, not a verified self-signature. Public-key equality likewise does not verify the certificate signature. The grader does not check that signature, current-time validity, a trust chain, SAN, key usage or extended key usage. Its DN extraction supports simple comma-separated RDNs and plus-separated attributes, but does not fully handle escaping or repeated attributes. Text checks establish presence, not labeling of dates or general script behavior on invalid inputs. The combined PEM checks compare the objects selected by OpenSSL; they do not impose a block count or compare private-key encodings byte for byte.

The verifier runs baked pytest directly and writes binary reward from its exit status. OpenSSL inspection commands have a 30-second timeout; submitted Python code retains the overall 900-second verifier allowance. These bounds do not provide isolation from shared filesystem authority. No build or runtime result is implied by these source descriptions.
