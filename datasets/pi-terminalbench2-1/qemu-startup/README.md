# QEMU startup

## Change Log

- [#1957](https://github.com/harbor-framework/terminal-bench/pull/1957) Pinned Bullseye security repository in agent environment.

Boot the supplied Alpine ISO in a background QEMU VM and leave its login console available through telnet at 127.0.0.1:6665. The reference uses a daemonized serial telnet server; another launcher or a relay to a real QEMU console is valid. No guest hostname or particular QEMU argument form is required.

The verifier checks for a QEMU-named process in its visible PID namespace, then makes a fresh telnet connection, refreshes the login prompt, logs in as root, requests uname -r and looks for kernel 6.6.4-1-lts in the session capture. Expect timeout/EOF and a nonzero process result fail. The shell conversation still assumes a conventional root prompt ending in '# '. Temporary files are scoped to the check; unrelated /tmp/data.txt is unused.

These are limited behavioral and process checks. The process name does not authenticate the executable, ISO or endpoint owner; a decoy process and a fabricated or foreign console remain a concern. A kernel substring anywhere in the session is weaker than binding it to the command response. PID and network namespace isolation, shared verifier authority and VM lifetime after the check depend on the harness. Network-disabled phases alone do not establish per-trial loopback isolation.

The image downloads and checks the pinned Alpine ISO bytes, creates a sparse 32 GiB virtual disk, and bakes QEMU, console tools and a Python 3.13 verifier environment with pytest 8.4.1 and pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5. Agent and verification phases require no downloads. Base-image, operating-system package, Python patch and transitive Python dependency versions are not all pinned. A 32 GiB virtual disk does not imply 32 GiB of initial host storage.

The reference propagates launch and file failures, polls the endpoint and waits for a login prompt with explicit timeout/EOF failure. This does not guarantee later service lifetime or process ownership. Resource declarations remain 1 CPU, 4 GiB memory, 10 GiB storage and 900-second agent/verifier limits. The wrapper maps all nonzero pytest statuses, including infrastructure errors, to zero. Static review does not establish a successful image build or VM/verifier run.
