# Hugging Face Model Inference

## Overview

This task requires setting up a local Flask API service that performs sentiment analysis using a pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model. The agent must load the pre-downloaded "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" model from the local Hugging Face cache, save it to a local directory, create a REST API endpoint, and run the service in the background.

## What It Tests

- **Machine Learning**: Working with Hugging Face transformers library
- **API Development**: Creating a Flask REST API with proper request/response handling
- **Service Management**: Running a background service and ensuring it's accessible
- **Error Handling**: Implementing proper HTTP error responses for invalid requests
- **Data Processing**: Processing text inputs and returning structured JSON responses

## Task Requirements

1. Load the pre-downloaded "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" model and its tokenizer from the local Hugging Face cache and save both to `/app/model_cache/sentiment_model`
2. Create a Flask API with a `/sentiment` POST endpoint that:
   - Accepts JSON: `{"text": "your text here"}`
   - Returns sentiment ("positive" or "negative") with confidence scores in [0, 1]
   - Handles errors with 400 status codes
3. Run the service on port 5000, accessible from 0.0.0.0
4. Keep the service running in the background, so it remains reachable after the agent session ends

## Environment Details

- **Base Image**: `python:3.13-slim-bookworm`
- **Pre-installed Packages**: transformers==4.56.0, torch==2.7.1, flask==3.1.1
- **Verifier Packages (baked)**: pytest==8.4.1, psutil==7.0.0, requests==2.32.4, pytest-json-ctrf==0.3.5
- **Model**: revision `714eb0fa89d2f80546fda750413ed43d93601a13`, pre-downloaded into the local Hugging Face cache (no runtime download)
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB storage
- **Internet Access**: None (offline image; the model is served from the local cache)
- **Timeout**: 15 minutes for both agent and verifier

## Verification

The test suite (`test_outputs.py`) checks:

1. **Model Saved**: Loads the saved model/tokenizer and compares parameter values, vocabulary and special tokens with the pinned checkpoint, while permitting different supported serialization formats.
2. **Service Running**: Checks HTTP reachability on port 5000 and a wildcard listener (0.0.0.0 or ::) with an owning process outside the verifier's process tree. Process names and creation times do not constrain deployment methods.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Generates fresh review strings and compares the live API probabilities and labels with trusted inference. Scores must match within 0.0001 numerical tolerance. The oracle loads only files whose upstream Git/LFS hashes were checked, excluding extra files placed in the shared cache.
4. **Response Format**: Validates JSON structure with required fields (`sentiment`, `confidence.positive`, `confidence.negative`)
5. **Error Handling**: Sends one object missing `text` and requires HTTP 400 plus a string-valued `error` key. Broader invalid-input handling is not checked.

Success requires all pytest tests to pass.

Fresh inputs and full probability comparisons reject the previous fixed-label lookup shortcut. This remains shared-environment grading: it does not isolate the Python runtime from a root-level solver or prove the service's internal implementation. Behavioral equivalence is accepted.

Flask application structure, inference APIs and launch methods may vary within the task contract and available offline packages. Direct model calls or a Transformers pipeline can both serve the required response. The reference uses `setsid`, but that is one launch method; its port polling and diagnostic requests do not independently establish child identity, full grading success or survival under every harness.

HTTP requests have connect/read timeouts, not an absolute deadline for a response that keeps delivering bytes. The reference stops on ordinary setup failures and runs from `/app`; its examples remain diagnostic. Tests assume the agent's files and live service persist into verification in the same environment. Listener selection, shared mutable tools/model files and process ownership do not provide isolation. Internal pytest failures still map to reward 0.

The model revision and upstream file hashes are pinned. Package versions are pinned directly, while transitive dependencies and base-image contents can drift. Rebuild the image when adopting this revision so the offline cache contains the pinned files.
