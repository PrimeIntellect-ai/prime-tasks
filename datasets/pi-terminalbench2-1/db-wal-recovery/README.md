# DB WAL Recovery Task

## Overview

This task challenges an agent to recover data from a SQLite database in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode where the WAL file has been XOR-encrypted. The agent must:

1. Identify that the WAL file is encrypted
2. Decrypt the WAL file (XOR cipher with key 0x42)
3. Extract all data from the database including WAL changes
4. Save the recovered data to `/app/recovered.json` in the specified format

The database contains 5 base records, but should have 11 total records after applying the WAL changes (6 new inserts + 2 updates to existing records).

## Skills Tested

- **SQLite database operations**: Understanding WAL mode and how SQLite uses write-ahead logging
- **File format analysis**: Examining hex dumps to identify file corruption/encryption
- **Cryptography**: Recognizing and implementing XOR decryption
- **Data extraction**: Querying SQLite and formatting results as JSON
- **Problem-solving**: Diagnosing why only partial data is visible and fixing the root cause
- **Python scripting**: Writing scripts to decrypt files and extract database contents

## Environment

- **Base Image**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Installed Tools**: Python 3, SQLite3, xxd, pip, venv; the verifier stack (pytest 8.4.1 + pytest-json-ctrf 0.3.5) is baked into the image at `/opt/venv`
- **Working Directory**: `/app`
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB storage
- **Files Provided**:
  - `main.db`: SQLite database file with 5 base records
  - `main.db-wal`: XOR-encrypted WAL file containing 6 additional records and updates
  - `main.db-wal.encrypted.orig`: pristine copy of the encrypted WAL (safety net; see below)

### WAL handling warning

Back up the encrypted WAL before opening the database. SQLite operations can reset
or remove WAL state; this is not an unconditional immediate-deletion rule for every
open. Read-only mode prevents database writes but can still involve sidecar files.
The `main.db-wal.encrypted.orig` copy permits another attempt after losing the live WAL.

### WAL structure note (for reproducibility)

The prior audit describes four frames, including committed page-2 states with 0,
5 and 11 rows. Its own description therefore permits different partial recovery
results; a truncated WAL does not necessarily yield 0 rows. It reports a lower WAL
page-1 change counter but a newer SQLite writer version than the base database.
These are different header fields. Frame contents, checksums and runtime replay
have not been regenerated during this review.

### Data integrity

- `main.db`: 8192 bytes, sha256 `68cb288eb29e76d814b4e7ee6887b37c415675e644f88173bc191348e290d119`
- `main.db-wal.encrypted`: 16512 bytes, sha256 `68753bdce26196a53194260d001544cc6bb8f9f38e2f2f6826d09798e31e6e26`

The task image is built locally from this directory's `environment/` files by the
taskset's `build_images.sh` (`pi-terminalbench2-1/db-wal-recovery:2.1`), so the
recipe uses these inputs. The mutable image tag does not attest which source bytes
were used by an existing image; record image provenance separately.

## Verification

The test suite (`test_outputs.py`) verifies:

- `/app/recovered.json` exists and contains valid JSON
- Data has the exact structure: list of objects with exactly the `id`, `name`, `value` fields
- All 11 records are recovered, with the complete expected rows asserted: every
  name AND every value for ids 1-11 (WAL updates: id 1 -> 150, id 2 -> 250; WAL
  inserts: ids 6-11). Incorrect guessed values fail; the exact answer still passes
  regardless of how it was obtained
- Records are sorted by `id`
- No duplicate IDs in the output

Grading intentionally checks only `/app/recovered.json`; it does not inspect
`main.db` / `main.db-wal`, because applying a decrypted WAL legitimately
may checkpoint and remove the WAL on connection close. The verifier runs in the
same container as the agent (shared mode) and reads the absolute in-container
path `/app/recovered.json`; this task requires that same-container verifier
behavior.

The intended task requires recovering the supplied data. SQLite replay and direct
record decoding can produce the same JSON; the grader does not prescribe a recovery
library or inspect the continued existence of a WAL after successful recovery.
The reference stops on failed decryption/extraction, and no longer opens the database
for a diagnostic query before decrypting. No fixed image or recovery run was performed
during this review. Data correctness and genuine recovery provenance are distinct.
